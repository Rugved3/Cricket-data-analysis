The methodologies involves web scraping data using BrightData and then performing data
cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python and Power BI. Here’s a detailed explanation of each step:
1. Web Scraping with BrightData: BrightData (formerly known as Luminati) is a platform
that provides data collection and web scraping services. You can use BrightData to extract data
from websites and online sources [4]. Here’s how the web scraping process works:
- Define your target websites or data sources: You specify the websites or online sources from
which you want to extract data.
- Create BrightData proxies: BrightData provides a network of proxies that allow you to access
5
websites while masking your identity and location.
- Write JavaScript code: You can write JavaScript code to interact with the websites and extract
the data you need. BrightData’s platform provides tools and documentation for writing custom
web scraping scripts in JavaScript.
- Execute the scraping: You run your scraping scripts on BrightData’s platform, which routes
the requests through its proxies, collects the data, and delivers it to you in a structured format,
typically JSON or other data formats.
2. Data Cleaning with Python (Pandas):
- After you’ve collected the data using BrightData, you may receive it in a raw format. [5]
Python, with the Pandas library, is a popular choice for data cleaning and preparation.
- In Python, you can load the extracted data into a Pandas DataFrame, which is a powerful data
structure for data manipulation and analysis.
- Data cleaning tasks may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting
data types, and transforming the data into a structured format suitable for analysis. [5]
3. Data Transformation with Power Query (Power BI):
- Once your data is cleaned and structured, you can further transform and shape it using Power
Query, a data transformation and preparation tool in Microsoft Power BI. [6]
- Power Query provides a user-friendly interface to perform various data transformation tasks,
such as filtering, merging data from different sources, pivoting, and aggregating.
- It allows you to create custom queries to meet your specific data transformation requirements. [7]
- Power Query can also handle tasks like data enrichment by integrating data from various
sources.
4. Data Visualization with Power BI:
- After transforming the data, you can create interactive and insightful data visualizations using
Power BI. [7]
- Power BI offers a wide range of visualization options, including bar charts, line charts, pie
charts, maps, and more, to present your data in a visually appealing and informative way.
- You can create dashboards and reports to showcase key insights and trends within your data.
- Power BI allows for real-time or scheduled data refresh, ensuring that your visualizations stay
up-to-date with the latest data.

5. Creating Dashboards in Power BI:
- In Power BI, you can combine multiple visualizations, tables, and reports into interactive
dashboards.
- Dashboards provide a consolidated view of your data, enabling users to explore the data and
gain insights at a glance.
- You can add slicers, filters, and drill-through features to make the dashboards more interactive
and user-friendly
